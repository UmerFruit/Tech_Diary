# About Tech Diary

Welcome to my technical learning journal! This is where I document my programming journey, dump my brain onto digital paper, and keep track of all the stuff I'll inevitably forget three months from now.

## What This Really Is

This site is primarily **my personal reference library**â€”a place where I store solutions, configurations, and "how did I do that again?" moments from my cybersecurity work. Think of it as my external hard drive for everything I've learned and whatever rabbit hole I've fallen into this week.

*Because we've all been there trying to find that one youtube video out of dozens that gave you that **ONE** command you needed, or an article that did things with exactly your setup*


While these notes are written for future-me, they might help you too.

## The Approach

Everything here is:
- **Tested in actual environments**, not just copy-pasted from documentation (*though sometimes it might be. hehe)* 
- **Documented while fresh** (before I forget why I did it that way)

If you're here because I sent you a link instead of explaining something for the fifth time, welcome! If you found this randomly and it helps, even better.

*Side effects may include solving your problem faster than expected.*
